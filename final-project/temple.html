The temple was rededicated on May 5, 2019 by Jeffrey R. Holland.</p>

            <p>The LDS Church First Presidency announced on October 14, 1998 that a temple would be built in Baton Rouge and a groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 8, 1999. The temple was open to the public for tours from July 1 through 8th, 2000. LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the temple on July 16, 2000. Four dedicatory services were held to accommodate the members who wanted to attend. Just before the first dedication service a cornerstone ceremony was held. The Baton Rouge Louisiana Temple serves 24,000 LDS Church members in the New Orleans, Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Denham Springs, and Monroe Louisiana stakes, as well as members in Gulfport, Hattiesburg, and Jackson, Mississippi stakes. The temple is 10,700 square feet, with a baptistry, two ordinance rooms, two sealing rooms, and a Celestial room. The exterior is made from Imperial Danby White marble quarried in Vermont, and the grounds are beautifully landscaped. The site is 6.3 acres, which includes a meetinghouse.</p>
